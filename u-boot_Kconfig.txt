config DEBUG_UART

	help
	  The debug UART is intended for use very early in U-Boot to debug

	  To use it you should:
	  - Make sure your UART supports this interface
	  - Enable CONFIG_DEBUG_UART
	  - Enable the CONFIG for your UART to tell it to provide this interface
	        (e.g. CONFIG_DEBUG_UART_NS16550)
	  - Define the required settings as needed (see below)
	  - Call debug_uart_init() before use
	  - Call debug_uart_putc() to output a character

	  Depending on your platform it may be possible to use this UART before
	  a stack is available.

	  If your UART does not support this interface you can probably add
	  support quite easily. Remember that you cannot use driver model and
	  it is preferred to use no stack.

	  You must not use this UART once driver model is working and the
	  serial drivers are up and running (done in serial_init()). Otherwise
	  the drivers may conflict and you will get strange output.

	   you need a low level bus controller driver, and some software
	   talking to it.  Peripheral controllers are often discrete silicon,

	  Universal Serial Bus (USB) is a specification for a serial bus
	  subsystem which offers higher speeds and more features than the
	  traditional PC serial port.  The bus supplies power to peripherals
	  and allows for hot swapping.  Up to 127 USB peripherals can be
	  connected to a single USB host in a tree structure.

	  The USB host is the root of the tree, the peripherals are the
	  leaves and the inner nodes are special USB devices called hubs.
	  Most PCs now have USB host ports, used to connect peripherals
	  such as scanners, keyboards, mice, modems, cameras, disks,
	  flash memory, network links, and printers to the PC.

	  Say Y here if your device has an USB port, either host, peripheral or
	  dual-role.

	  For an USB host port, you then need to say Y to at least one of the
	  Host Controller Driver (HCD) options below.  Choose a USB 1.1
	  controller, such as "UHCI HCD support" or "OHCI HCD support",
	  and "EHCI HCD (USB 2.0) support" except for older systems that
	  do not have USB 2.0 support.  It doesn't normally hurt to select
	  them all if you are not certain.

	  If your system has a device-side USB port, used in the peripheral
	  side of the USB protocol, see the "USB Gadget" framework instead.

	  After choosing your HCD, then select drivers for the USB peripherals
	  you'll be using.  You may want to check out the information provided
	  in <file:Documentation/usb/> and especially the links given in

	  (MaxNVB is basically the total count of eraseblocks on the chip).

	  To put it differently, if this value is 20, UBI will try to reserve
	  about 1.9% of physical eraseblocks for bad blocks handling. And that
	  will be 1.9% of eraseblocks on the entire NAND chip, not just the MTD
	  partition UBI attaches. This means that if you have, say, a NAND
	  flash chip admits maximum 40 bad eraseblocks, and it is split on two
	  MTD partitions of the same size, UBI will reserve 40 eraseblocks when
	  attaching a partition.

	  This option can be overridden by the "mtd=" UBI module parameter or
	  by the "attach" ioctl.

	   Important: this feature is experimental so far and the on-flash

	   Fastmap is a mechanism which allows attaching an UBI device
	   in nearly constant time. Instead of scanning the whole MTD device it
	   only has to locate a checkpoint (called fastmap) on the device.
	   The on-flash fastmap contains all information needed to attach
	   the device. Using fastmap makes only sense on large devices where
	   attaching by scanning takes long. UBI will not automatically install
	   a fastmap on old images, but you can set the UBI module parameter
	   fm_autoconvert to 1 if you want so. Please note that fastmap-enabled
	   images are still usable with UBI implementations without
	   fastmap support. On typical flash devices the whole fastmap fits
	   into one PEB. UBI will reserve PEBs to hold two fastmaps.

	  If this option is disabled (it is the only possible choice for non-DT
	  boards), the pinctrl core provides no systematic mechanism for

	help
	  On Zynq and ZynqMP U-Boot SPL (or U-Boot proper if
	  ZYNQMP_PSU_INIT_ENABLED is set) is responsible for some
	  basic initializations, such as enabling peripherals and
	  configuring pinmuxes. The PS init file (called
	  psu_init_gpl.c on ZynqMP, ps7_init_gpl.c for Zynq-7000)
	  contains the code for such initializations.

	  U-Boot contains PS init files for some boards, but each of
	  them describes only one specific configuration. Users of a
	  different board, or needing a different configuration, can
	  generate custom files using the Xilinx development tools.

	  There are three ways to give a PS init file to U-Boot:

	  1. Set this variable to the path, either relative to the
	     source tree or absolute, where the psu_init_gpl.c or
	     ps7_init_gpl.c file is located. U-Boot will build this
	     file.

	  2. If you leave an empty string here, U-Boot will use
	     board/xilinx/zynq/$(CONFIG_DEFAULT_DEVICE_TREE)/ps7_init_gpl.c
	     for Zynq-7000, or
	     board/xilinx/zynqmp/$(CONFIG_DEFAULT_DEVICE_TREE)/psu_init_gpl.c
	     for ZynqMP.

	  3. If the above file does not exist, U-Boot will use
	     board/xilinx/zynq/ps7_init_gpl.c for Zynq-7000, or
	     board/xilinx/zynqmp/psu_init_gpl.c for ZynqMP. This file
	     is not provided by U-Boot, you have to copy it there
	     before the build.

config TARGET_SLIMBOOTLOADER
	bool "slimbootloader"
	help
	  This target is used for running U-Boot on top of Slim Bootloader
	  boot firmware as a payload. Slim Bootloader does memory initialization
	  and silicon initialization, and it passes necessary information in
	  HOB (Hand Off Block) to a payload. The payload consumes HOB data
	  which is generated by Slim Bootloader for its driver initialization.
	  Slim Bootloader consumes FSP and its HOB, but FSP HOB is cleared
	  Before launching a payload. Instead, Slim Bootloader generates its
	  HOB data such as memory info, serial port info and so on.
	  Refer to doc/board/intel/slimbootloader.rst for the details.

config CMD_IOTRACE
	bool "iotrace - Support for tracing I/O activity"
	help
	  Provides an 'iotrace' command which supports recording I/O reads and
	  writes in a trace buffer in memory . It also maintains a checksum
	  of the trace records (even if space is exhausted) so that the
	  sequence of I/O accesses can be verified.

	  When debugging drivers it is useful to see what I/O accesses were
	  done and in what order.

	  Even if the individual accesses are of little interest it can be
	  useful to verify that the access pattern is consistent each time
	  an operation is performed. In this case a checksum can be used to
	  characterise the operation of a driver. The checksum can be compared
	  across different runs of the operation to verify that the driver is
	  working properly.

	  In particular, when performing major refactoring of the driver, where
	  the access pattern should not change, the checksum provides assurance
	  that the refactoring work has not broken the driver.

	  This works by sneaking into the io.h heder for an architecture and
	  redirecting I/O accesses through iotrace's tracing mechanism.

	  For now no commands are provided to examine the trace buffer. The
	  format is fairly simple, so 'md' is a reasonable substitute.

	  Note: The checksum feature is only useful for I/O regions where the
	  contents do not change outside of software control. Where this is not
	  suitable you can fall back to manually comparing the addresses. It
	  might be useful to enhance tracing to only checksum the accesses and
	  not the data read/written.

	  a) The environment occupies one whole flash sector, which is
	   "embedded" in the text segment with the U-Boot code. This
	   happens usually with "bottom boot sector" or "top boot
	   sector" type flash chips, which have several smaller
	   sectors at the start or the end. For instance, such a
	   layout can have sector sizes of 8, 2x4, 16, Nx32 kB. In
	   such a case you would place the environment in one of the
	   4 kB sectors - with U-Boot code before and after it. With
	   "top boot sector" type flash chips, you would put the
	   environment in one of the last sectors, leaving a gap
	   between U-Boot and the environment.

	  CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET:

	   Offset of environment data (variable area) to the
	   beginning of flash memory; for instance, with bottom boot
	   type flash chips the second sector can be used: the offset
	   for this sector is given here.

	   CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET is used relative to CONFIG_SYS_FLASH_BASE.

	  CONFIG_ENV_ADDR:

	   This is just another way to specify the start address of
	   the flash sector containing the environment (instead of
	   CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET).

	  CONFIG_ENV_SECT_SIZE:

	   Size of the sector containing the environment.


	  b) Sometimes flash chips have few, equal sized, BIG sectors.
	   In such a case you don't want to spend a whole sector for
	   the environment.

	  CONFIG_ENV_SIZE:

	   If you use this in combination with CONFIG_ENV_IS_IN_FLASH
	   and CONFIG_ENV_SECT_SIZE, you can specify to use only a part
	   of this flash sector for the environment. This saves
	   memory for the RAM copy of the environment.

	   It may also save flash memory if you decide to use this
	   when your environment is "embedded" within U-Boot code,
	   since then the remainder of the flash sector could be used
	   for U-Boot code. It should be pointed out that this is
	   STRONGLY DISCOURAGED from a robustness point of view:
	   updating the environment in flash makes it always
	   necessary to erase the WHOLE sector. If something goes
	   wrong before the contents has been restored from a copy in
	   RAM, your target system will be dead.

	  CONFIG_ENV_ADDR_REDUND
	  CONFIG_ENV_SIZE_REDUND

	   These settings describe a second storage area used to hold
	   a redundant copy of the environment data, so that there is
	   a valid backup copy in case there is a power failure during
	   a "saveenv" operation.

	  BE CAREFUL! Any changes to the flash layout, and some changes to the
	  source code will make it necessary to adapt <board>/u-boot.lds*
	  accordingly!

	  CONFIG_SYS_MMC_ENV_DEV:

	  Specifies which MMC device the environment is stored in.

	  CONFIG_SYS_MMC_ENV_PART (optional):

	  Specifies which MMC partition the environment is stored in. If not
	  set, defaults to partition 0, the user area. Common values might be
	  1 (first MMC boot partition), 2 (second MMC boot partition).

	  CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET:
	  CONFIG_ENV_SIZE:

	  These two #defines specify the offset and size of the environment
	  area within the specified MMC device.

	  If offset is positive (the usual case), it is treated as relative to
	  the start of the MMC partition. If offset is negative, it is treated
	  as relative to the end of the MMC partition. This can be useful if
	  your board may be fitted with different MMC devices, which have
	  different sizes for the MMC partitions, and you always want the
	  environment placed at the very end of the partition, to leave the
	  maximum possible space before it, to store other data.

	  These two values are in units of bytes, but must be aligned to an
	  MMC sector boundary.

	  CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET_REDUND (optional):

	  Specifies a second storage area, of CONFIG_ENV_SIZE size, used to
	  hold a redundant copy of the environment data. This provides a
	  valid backup copy in case the other copy is corrupted, e.g. due
	  to a power failure during a "saveenv" operation.

	  This value may also be positive or negative; this is handled in the
	  same way as CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET.

	  This value is also in units of bytes, but must also be aligned to
	  an MMC sector boundary.

	  CONFIG_ENV_SIZE_REDUND (optional):

	  set. If this value is set, it must be set to the same value as
	  CONFIG_ENV_SIZE.

	  during a "saveenv" operation.	 CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET_REDUND must be
	  aligned to an erase block boundary.

	  - CONFIG_ENV_RANGE (optional):

	  Specifies the length of the region in which the environment
	  can be written.  This should be a multiple of the NAND device's
	  block size.  Specifying a range with more erase blocks than
	  are needed to hold CONFIG_ENV_SIZE allows bad blocks within
	  the range to be avoided.

	  - CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET_OOB (optional):

	  Enables support for dynamically retrieving the offset of the
	  environment from block zero's out-of-band data.  The
	  "nand env.oob" command can be used to record this offset.
	  Currently, CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET_REDUND is not supported when

	  Enable support for GPIOs (General-purpose Input/Output) in SPL.
	  GPIOs allow U-Boot to read the state of an input line (high or
	  low) and set the state of an output line. This can be used to
	  drive LEDs, control power to various system parts and read user

	  I2C works with a clock and data line which can be driven by a
	  one or more masters or slaves. It is a fairly complex bus but is
	  widely used as it only needs two lines for communication. Speeds of
	  400kbps are typical but up to 3.4Mbps is supported by some
	  hardware. I2C can be useful in SPL to configure power management

	  to be split up into separate regions, with a partition table placed
	  at the start or end which describes the location and size of each
	  'partition'. These partitions are typically uses as individual block
	  devices, typically with an EXT2 or FAT filesystem in each. This

	  This provides support for reading images from CRAMFS (Compressed ROM
	  filesystem). CRAMFS is useful when space is tight since files are
	  compressed. You can also enable CMD_CRAMFS to get command-line
	  access.
config FS_JFFS2
	bool "Enable JFFS2 filesystem support"
	help
	  This provides support for reading images from JFFS2 (Journalling
	  Flash File System version 2). JFFS2 is a log-structured file system
	  for use with flash memory devices. It supports raw NAND devices,
	  hard links and compression.
config FS_FAT
	bool "Enable FAT filesystem support"
	help
	  This provides support for reading images from File Allocation Table
	  (FAT) filesystem. FAT filesystem is a legacy, lightweight filesystem.
	  It is useful mainly for its wide compatibility with various operating
	  systems. You can also enable CMD_FAT to get access to fat commands.

config FAT_WRITE
	bool "Enable FAT filesystem write support"
	depends on FS_FAT
	help
	  This provides support for creating and writing new files to an
	  existing FAT filesystem partition.

config FS_FAT_MAX_CLUSTSIZE
	int "Set maximum possible clustersize"
	default 65536
	depends on FS_FAT
	help
	  Set the maximum possible clustersize for the FAT filesytem. This
	  is the smallest amount of disk space that can be used to hold a
	  file. Unless you have an extremely tight memory memory constraints,
	  leave the default.
config FS_CBFS
	bool "Enable CBFS (Coreboot Filesystem)"
	help
	  Define this to enable support for reading from a Coreboot
	  filesystem. This is a ROM-based filesystem used for accessing files
	  on systems that use coreboot as the first boot-loader and then load
	  U-Boot to actually boot the Operating System. You can also enable
	  CMD_CBFS to get command-line access.

config SPL_FS_CBFS
	bool "Enable CBFS (Coreboot Filesystem) in SPL"
	help
	  Define this to enable support for reading from a Coreboot
	  filesystem. This is a ROM-based filesystem used for accessing files
	  on systems that use coreboot as the first boot-loader and then load
	  U-Boot to actually boot the Operating System.

	  Note that most functions in the CBFS API do not work with SPL. Only
	  those which accept a cbfs_priv * can be used, since BSS is not
	  available.
config FS_EXT4
	bool "Enable ext4 filesystem support"
	help
	  This provides support for reading images from the ext4 filesystem.
	  ext4 is a widely used general-purpose filesystem for Linux.
	  You can also enable CMD_EXT4 to get access to ext4 commands.

config EXT4_WRITE
	bool "Enable ext4 filesystem write support"
	depends on FS_EXT4
	help
	  This provides support for creating and writing new files to an
	  existing ext4 filesystem partition.
config YAFFS2
	bool "YAFFS2 filesystem support"
	help
	  This provides access to YAFFS2 filesystems. Yet Another Flash
	  Filesystem 2 is a filesystem designed specifically for NAND flash.
	  It incorporates bad-block management and ensures that device
	  writes are sequential regardless of filesystem activity.
